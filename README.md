# MIS-Reports
-------
MIS (Management Information System) reports provide a concise view on the various parameters that are vital to the company . For example - Revenue , Order book , Customer satisfaction , HR indices , Attrition are few of the components. They can be as simple as a single page report to a more detailed and comprehensive report.

Here I have build 4 (1+3) MIS Reports. One is the overall report taking into consideration all the locations and other three are location specific reports where the locations are DEL(Delhi), GGN (Gurgaon) and NOI (Noida) respectively. 

I have used Python to build these reports.
